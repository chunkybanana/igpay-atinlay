## A bunch of pig latin translators in different languages

## Usage
### In any of these languages, include as needed then you can just call the pigLatin function. 
### Javascript
```html
    <script src='./piglatin.js'></script>
```
---
### Typescript
I just did this one because I was bored - it's identical to the Javascript one. Don't bother. 
---
### Coffeescript
Also just did this one because I was bored. No idea either...
---
### Ruby
```ruby
    require_relative('piglatin')
```
---
### Php
```php
    require "piglatin.php";
```

### Java
I haven't figured out how to use packages, so for now, direct copy+paste. 

## Note: reverse pig latin is very tricky, as there is no way to tell how many letters have been moved.
